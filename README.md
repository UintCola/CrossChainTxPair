# CrossChainTxPair
# Eg: Bsc mainnet shift to Heco mainnet,lock like 1000UINC and get tx hash,use the tx hash on BSC and then on Heco mainnet unlock the same amount 1000UINC with tx hash generated by BSC mainnet.
# Later on we will use scripts/smartcontract to automaticial follow the _lock_UINC_addr amount on diffrent chain to show the cross-chain transfers.
# So the public will always know how the coin be shifted.
